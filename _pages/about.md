I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Iowa State University, working under the guidance of Prof. Vaswani. My research focuses on developing algorithms for MRI reconstruction. My research interests include compressed sensing, physics-based unrolling, and unsupervised and self-supervised learning techniques for MRI reconstruction.
